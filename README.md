## Problem Statement

### Title
AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance for Healthcare Equipment

### Category
Healthcare

### Description
Healthcare facilities, especially in rural and underserved areas, often face
challenges with medical equipment breakdowns due to lack of timely maintenance.
These breakdowns disrupt critical patient care services and lead to increased
operational costs.

The problem lies in the absence of real-time monitoring and predictive insights
for healthcare equipment. Hospitals and clinics usually rely on scheduled
maintenance or reactive measures after a failure occurs, which is inefficient
and expensive. Examples include diagnostic machines like CT/MRI scanners,
ventilators, or blood-testing devices that often require calibration and repair,
leading to downtime.

The challenge is to develop an AI-powered solution that uses data from IoT
sensors, historical maintenance records, and environmental factors (like
temperature or humidity) to predict when and why medical equipment might fail.
The solution should provide actionable insights to healthcare providers,
enabling them to plan proactive maintenance and minimize equipment downtime.

### Expected Outcome
- An AI model capable of analysing IoT and maintenance data to predict failures
and recommend preventive actions.

- A prototype dashboard or application that visualizes equipment health, urgency
of maintenance, and cost implications.

- Improved uptime of medical equipment in healthcare facilities, especially in
resource-constrained settings.

## Installation
